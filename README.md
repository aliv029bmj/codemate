# CodeMate

**CodeMate** transforms your VS Code line/column indicator into a fun, interactive experience with selectable user modes. Make your coding sessions more engaging and enjoyable!

## Features

CodeMate enhances your coding experience by replacing the standard line/column display with one of six interactive modes:

### 1. Story Mode
Read a progressive story that changes as you navigate through your code. Each line jump reveals the next part of the tale.

### 2. Pixel Pet
Adopt a virtual pet that reacts to your coding behavior. Keep coding to level up your pet and keep it happy!

### 3. Music By Code
Generate ambient music based on your cursor movements. Different lines produce different notes, and columns affect volume.

### 4. Riddle Mode
Challenge yourself with riddles that change as you navigate through your code. Click on the riddle to toggle the answer.

### 5. Travel Mode
Virtually travel to different cities around the world as you navigate through your code. The further you move, the further you travel!

### 6. Stats HUD
Get real-time coding statistics including character count, lines, functions, and typing speed. Toggle a detailed dashboard view for more info.

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Choose your preferred mode via:
   - Command Palette: `CodeMate: Select Mode`
   - Status bar: Click on the CodeMate indicator
3. Watch your status bar transform into something more interesting than just line and column numbers!

## Extension Settings
